# TextDetection
This project focuses on detecting and extracting text from images using Python. It leverages OpenCV (cv2) for image processing, pytesseract for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), and NumPy for efficient numerical operations. The system preprocesses images to enhance text clarity and accurately recognizes printed text from various image sources.
